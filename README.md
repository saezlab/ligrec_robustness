# Analysing Robustness of CCI Inference Methods

## Objectives:
This is a rapidly developing project, but the current aim is to analyse how the
predictions of ligrec analysis methods change after the resources they run with
have been manipulated in various ways.

## Prerequisites:
This code has all the same dependencies as LIANA (mainly Seurat and tidyverse) 
and requires LIANA to run. It shouldn't have any others. You can check out the 
LIANA installation and tutorial [here](https://github.com/saezlab/liana) (you 
probably now that, but I wanted to test using a link in markdown).

## Subfolders:
1. **Code**: All the code can be found here, including the code that collects the right data for you.
2. **Data**: When you run the code that collects the right data it will be stored here.
