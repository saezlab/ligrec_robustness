# Analyzing Robustness of CCI Inference Methods

## Objectives:

This is a rapidly developing project, but the current aim is to analyse how the predictions of ligrec analysis methods change after the resources they run with have been manipulated in various ways. In future, the project looks to expand to the manipulation of cell cluster annotations.

## Prerequisites:

This code has all the same dependencies as LIANA (mainly Seurat and tidyverse) and requires LIANA++ to run. In addition, it makes use of lubridate for runtime calculations. You can get an overview of LIANA [here](https://github.com/saezlab/liana), and learn more about LIANA++ [here](https://saezlab.github.io/liana/articles/liana_devel.html).

## Sub-folders:

1.  **Code**: All the code can be found here, including the the GetData script.
2.  **Data**: When you run the GetData script input data will be collected and deposited here.
3.  **Outputs**: This is where scripts will drop their results if they're saving them to the PC.
